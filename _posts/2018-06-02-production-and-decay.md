Put simply, the Higgs particle is extraordinarily difficult to create. Not only is it produced in *less than a billionth of the collisions* at the Large Hadron Collider, but it also exists on the order of 10<sup>-22</sup> seconds before interacting with other matter — a lifetime is far too short to be measured directly. To understand how the LHC pulled it off, we have two main questions to investigate:

How we can make a Higgs boson?

When protons collide in the Large Hadron Collider, their interactions can result in a whole host of outcomes. Sometimes photons are produced, carrying energy locked up within the momentum and mass of the colliding particles by E = mc<sup>2</sup> (energy = mass). Other times, we get other particles, and *in very rare cases* we can get a Higgs. How?

Recall that *particles acquire mass via their interactions with the Higgs particle.* Said differently, this also means that the Higgs is more likely to be produced via interacting with heavier particles. Who’s the heaviest particle on the block? The Standard Model tells us that it’s the top quark: *340,000 times heavier than an electron!*

Our question now is, how can we find a way to get top quarks to interact? When two protons collide, a jumbled mess of quarks and gluons meet each other. If two gluons collide, there can be so much energy that the gluons couple to top quarks which can then couple to Higgs Particles in an incredible process known as ***gluon-gluon fusion***.

At the Large Hadron Collider, *gluon-gluon fusion* is the most likely means to produce the Higgs particle, accounting for 87% of Higgs particles produced. Notice that the Feynman diagram shows how gluons inside the two colliding protons do not couple directly to the Higgs particle, as the Higgs can only couple to massive particles. Instead, they produce a virtual top quark/antitop quark loop that couple to the Higgs particle and recombine to produce it. It is important to note that the Higgs reacts proportionally to the mass of a particle—mass is like a “Higgs Charge” of sorts that relates to a Higgs field permeating all of space. Accordingly, top and bottom quarks are the heaviest quarks, so this process is generally thought of with loops of virtual top or bottom quarks.

A similar phenomenon occurs in another Higgs production method known as **vector boson fusion**. Notice that in this case it’s W and Z bosons that fuse into the Higgs particle, two of the next heaviest particles we know of. Other known methods of producing a Higgs include vector boson radiation and top radiation. For our purposes, we’ll move on to how the Higgs decays.

Once we have a Higgs, how can we see it?

Similar to production, Higgs particles can decay into anything they couple to. From the previous discussion, it should be no surprise that decay probability is proportional to the mass of the decay products and how much available energy there is. Decay happens very quickly after its production (remember the Higgs’ mean lifetime is approximately 1.6 x 10-22 s), so the particles that result are actually how we find the Higgs!

See that sliver of the pie dedicated to photon decay? Experimentalists love this. The total energy deposited by the two photons in the LHC’s electromagnetic calorimeters and their momentum can be measured very precisely (we’ll revisit this later).

Another favorable, though unlikely, possibility that pleases experimentalists is when the Higgs decays into a pair of Z bosons.

The Z bosons decay into a pair of easily detectable charged leptons. The Higgs is most likely to decay into a heavy fermion-antifermion pair or split into a pair of massive W gauge bosons. These are much harder to detect, so the LHC collides protons many times until a more favorable decay can be observed.
