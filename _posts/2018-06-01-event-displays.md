The beauty of particle collisions at the LHC emerges in the **event display**. Experimentalists use event displays to visualize the data on the paths of particles after each collision like in the image above. Each event display has several key components such as event title, event number, run number, as well as the date of the experiment. This allows for scientists to access and report individual events and compare data with ease.

The first experiments used photos for collision detection in the 1930s. For nearly fifty years, this was the only way by which scientists were able to assess particle interaction. When the digital age of computing exploded in the late 1970s, the first computer graphics were used to visualize different collisions. Event displays continued to grow more complex throughout the late 1990s, and today, many display 3D representations of the collision.


## Seeing collisions in action
* [Navigate to CERN’s OpenData CMS event visualizer](http://opendata.cern.ch/visualise/events/cms)
* Notice the different detecting features available on the left. To start the simulation, click on the open folder icon on the top left.
* When prompted, choose “Open file(s) from the Web” and then choose “Higgs Candidates”
* Select either diphoton.ig or 4lepton.ig. Figure 1 will show the diphoton products whereas Figure 2 will represent the 4lepton.ig event.

*Figure 1.*

Above is the event data of a Higgs decay into two photons. Notice that the there is no track data within the inner detector, and thus no track data pointing to the calorimeter. This is indicative of the fact that photons cannot be detected by the electromagnetic calorimeter, but they can be detected by the hadronic calorimeter.

*Figure 2.*

The four leptons that result from the decay of the Higgs are detected by the outermost muon detectors (red). The muons technically interact with the electromagnetic field, but since they are nearly 200 times more massive than the electron, they do not lose nearly as much energy in their path. Thus, there is no visible detection in the electromagnetic calorimeter.
