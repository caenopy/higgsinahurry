The real story begins at the Large Hadron Collider, the largest most powerful particle collider in the world operated by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).

ATLAS and CMS are two of the seven particle detector experiments within the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland. The experiments were built on opposite sides of the complex to serve the same purpose with slightly different compromises and capabilities. In both experiments, the detecting mechanisms are built surrounding the interaction points of proton-proton collisions.

## ATLAS

The ATLAS detector consists of several concentric cylinders which can measure the various properties of any elementary particle. As we break them down, play around with the applet below!

### Inner Detectors
The first layer of detection involves tracking charged particles as based upon their respective interaction with different materials at various points of the experiment. A magnetic field bends their paths which gives us information about each particles momentum.

### Electromagnetic Calorimeter
ATLAS’s Electromagnetic Calorimeter measures the energy of electromagnetically interacting particles by sampling the energy a particle deposits in a high-density metal. High density metals include lead and copper. The lead acts as the interactor whereas the copper electrodes collect the deposited energy. Liquid argon separates the metals. Particles interacting with the lead cause a *particle shower of new photons and electrons*. Such showers will be able to displace electrons in the argon, which can be measured by the copper electrodes.

### Hadronic Calorimeter
The Hadronic Calorimeter detects the energy of *hadrons* (like protons, neutrons, and pions). In the applet above, notice that the hadrons are produced in *jets* and leave energy along both calorimeters.

### Muon System
The last layer belongs to the Muon Spectrometer. These are able to accurately measure the momentum of muons as these leptons are able to pass through all other parts of the experiment undetected.

### Magnet System
The magnetic system curves the path of charged particles in the Inner Detector and Muon Spectrometer. As mentioned, the direction of the curve indicates the charge of the particle while the amount it curves reveals its momentum.

## CMS

Elements of the CMS experiment are similar to ATLAS, but it is important to note that it tracks the particles in a different way. The experiment weighs around 14,000 tonnes and consists of the following five layers:

### The Tracker
The momentum of the particle is tracked based on the particle's curvature throughout a magnetic field. The CMS tracker monitors the location of the particle at certain points in order to calculate its momentum.

### The Electromagnetic Calorimeter
The electromagnetic calorimeter is made of lead-tungstate crystals. Much like ATLAS, the emitted electrons and photos of the collision interact with the lead atoms, but the key difference is that shower excites the atoms in the crystal. In the process of de-excitation, the crystals release photons, which are then counted to determine the energy of the initial particle.

### The Hadronic Calorimeter
This part of the detector measures the energy of hadrons. A hadron is defined as any particle made up of quarks and gluons such as a proton or neutron. Neutrinos usually cannot be detected, but their presence can be monitored by the Hadron Calorimeter in any momentum imbalance observed during particle detection.

### The Magnet
The CMS magnet has a 4 Tesla magnetic field that is 100,000 times stronger than the Earth's. The charge/mass ratio can be determined based on the path they take in the field. The greater the particle momentum, the lesser the curve of the path. Originally, the CMS was to have a much stronger magnet because, as the field strength increased, the particles would bend more, allowing for more accurate detection of the momentum of particles with higher energy. However, to increase longevity, the field was kept at a maximum of 4 T.

### The Muon Detectors
Like the ATLAS, the muon detectors detect muons which are similar leptons to electrons but two hundred times more massive. The muon detector of the CMS is the outermost layer and very important as one of the biggest indicators of Higgs decay are four muon products.

**On 4 July 2012, both of the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN announced they had independently discovered an unknown boson with mass 125.3 ± 0.6 GeV/c.**
