> This guide assumes a degree non-mathematical understanding of the Standard Model and Feynman Diagrams. There is an abundance of descriptive explanations of these concepts. We find that Quantum Diaries’ [Feynman Diagrams](https://www.quantumdiaries.org/2010/02/14/lets-draw-feynman-diagams/) and CERN’s [Standard Model](https://home.cern/about/physics/standard-model) are excellent.

Thousands of scientists and the most complex experimental facility ever constructed have given us the greatest particle physics triumph of the past 50 years — and a proportionate number of people have tried to explain it.

Across the web, there exists an abundance of documents, tools, and lesson plans created by scientists and educators to explain the Large Hadron Collider. By pooling together the best resources out there, this page will take you through the story of **how the Higgs was created and how we know that we’ve found it**.
